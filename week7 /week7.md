## Explanations of hindsight bias

1. Self-serving bias
2. Memory confusion
    - Part of the bias is automatic and is not due to motivational factors
    - Sometimes, we may need to show more forgiveness to those who exhibit hindsight biases


However,
-  There is one situation in which people exhibit no hindsight bias…
    - Try to give me your insights into this situation..

- When one’s initial decision led to negative results, people tend to say: 
    - The results are out of my prediction…

***Again self-serving…***
